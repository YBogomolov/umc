# TypeScript Rules

1. Avoid `any` at all costs.
2. Avoid casting stuff using `as unknown as X`. Always use correct types and let the compiler do inference.
3. Always specify input and output types of a function.
4. Prefer functional programming style to OO design.

# General rules

1. Keep MEMORY.md file with all your important decisions, findings, and ideas. Never overwrite this file, only append.
