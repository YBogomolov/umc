# Universal Miniature Creator

> **Disclaimer:** This is a 100% vibe-coded project. If this is not your jam, feel free to ignore.

Universal Miniature Creator is a small project of mine. One of my hobbies is tabletop miniature wargames, and as a papercraft enthusiast, I find it rather difficult to find good representations of my characters. With Gemini 2.5 Nano Banana (_who on earth comes up with those stupid names?_), I got myself a nice tool to cover my specific needs. Now, with UMC, I am streamlining my experience.

This project is a "bring your own key" solution, meaning you can create a free tier Gemini key to use this app. There's little to see without a key, so the onboarding is rather minimalistic.
